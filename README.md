# Titantic Data Analysis

Explored datasets through asking and answering questions about the Titanic Dataset.

## Questions Explored

1. Which gender had a better chance of survival?
2. Which social class had a better chance of survival?
3. Which age group had a better chance of survival?

## Overview

This project involves data analysis on the Titanic dataset, exploring various aspects of passengers' survival chances.

## Libraries Used

- [Matplotlib]: A library for basic data visualization
- [Numpy]: A library for advanced mathematical computation
- [Pandas]: A library for handling and manipulating tables of data
- [Seaborn]: A statistical data visualization library based on Matplotlib

Calculated mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation, and correlations between different features of the data.

**Variance:** A measure of how spread out the data is or, in other words, it measures how far a set of numbers is spread out from their average value.

**Standard Deviation:** It helps us by knowing whether the data huddles near the mean or is spread out far away from the mean.

**Correlation:** The degree to which two or more attributes or measurements on the same group of elements show a tendency to vary together.

## Correlations Explored

1. Is there a correlation between age and fare price?
2. Is there a correlation between class and survival? Did rich people survive more than the working people?
3. Was there a correlation between age and survival? Did they really allow "women and children first"?

### Conditional Probability and Percentage

1. What was the probability of survival for a child? P(Survived=true | Age<16)
2. What was the probability of survival for a woman? P(Survived= true | Sex=female)
3. What was the probability of survival for a man? P(Survived= true | Sex=male)
4. What was the probability of survival for a particular gender based on the class?
